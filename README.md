Right now, the trick I have up my sleeve is a heart. I’m a passionate man and that passion can become a superpower when I channel it into my work. It is the source of my creativity and gives me the stamina to last through difficult delivery schedules.

The goal that I’m aspiring to as a higher level of understanding.  I want to know how it all works, and software development touches on everything in our lives today. It’s a field where knowing a little bit about everything can make you an expert in this very powerful something. The work itself is my goal: I want to enjoy what I do, and I want what I do to bring joy to the world, whether it’s a fun new game or an office productivity suite that can make tedious tasks less painful.
